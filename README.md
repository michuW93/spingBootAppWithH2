# spingBootAppWithH2
test/example spring boot app with h2 db, flyway. Just for playing with jpa

To open h2 console - open browser and go to http://localhost:8080/h2-console


DONE: add flyway because now can't insert to table created by DAO class: @Table(name = "employees").

DONE: fix controller -> service -> dao

DONE: add second table

TODO: add entity class for department

TODO: connect entities (employee with department)
